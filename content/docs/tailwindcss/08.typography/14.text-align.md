## 示例

### 左对齐文本

使用 `text-left` 工具将元素的文本左对齐：

::BaseFigure
:::example{padding=false}
<div class="px-4 sm:px-0">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
    <p class="text-left">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
      my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
      kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
:::

```html
<p class="text-left">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```
::

### 右对齐文本

使用 `text-right` 工具将元素的文本右对齐：

::BaseFigure
:::example{padding=false}
<div class="px-4 sm:px-0">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
    <p class="text-right">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
      my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
      kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
:::

```html
<p class="text-right">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```
::

### 居中对齐文本

使用 `text-center` 工具将元素的文本居中对齐：

::BaseFigure
:::example{padding=false}
<div class="px-4 sm:px-0">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
    <p class="text-center">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
      my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
      kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
:::

```html
<p class="text-center">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```
::

### 两端对齐文本

使用 `text-justify` 工具将元素的文本两端对齐：

::BaseFigure
:::example{padding=false}
<div class="px-4 sm:px-0">
  <div class="mx-auto max-w-lg p-8 text-sm/6 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-200">
    <p class="text-justify">
      So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made
      my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the
      kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I <em>was</em> a marine biologist.
    </p>
  </div>
</div>
:::

```html
<p class="text-justify">So I started to walk into the water...</p>
```
::

### 响应式设计

在 `text-align` 工具前加上像 `md:` 这样的断点变体，以便只在中等屏幕尺寸及以上应用该工具：

```html
<p class="text-left md:text-center ...">
  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
</p>
```
