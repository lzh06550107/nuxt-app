## 示例

### 阻止父元素过度滚动

使用 `overscroll-contain` 实用工具来阻止目标区域的滚动触发父元素的滚动，但在支持此功能的操作系统中，当滚动超出容器末端时，保留 “回弹” 效果：

::BaseFigure{hint="滚动查看效果"}
:::example{padding=false}
  <div class="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-contain p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
    <p>
      Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
      one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
      to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
      making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
      What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
      me give you a hint, junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
      we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
      opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
      drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
      Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?
    </p>
  </div>
:::

```html
<div class="overscroll-contain ...">是这样的，我说你这滑稽的小家伙，...</div>
```
::

### 阻止过度滚动回弹

使用 `overscroll-none` 实用工具来阻止目标区域的滚动触发父元素的滚动，并阻止滚动超出容器末端时的“回弹”效果：

::BaseFigure
:::example{padding=false}
<div class="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-none p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
  <p>
    Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
    one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
    to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
    making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
    What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
    me give you a hint, junior.
  </p>

    we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
    opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
    drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
    Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?
  </p>
</div>
:::

```html
<div class="overscroll-none ...">是这样的，我说你这滑稽的小家伙，...</div>
```

### 使用默认的过度滚动行为

当用户到达主要滚动区域的边界时，使用 `overscroll-auto` 实用工具使其能够继续滚动父滚动区域：

::BaseFigure{hint="滚动查看效果"}
:::example{padding=false}
<div class="h-48 space-y-4 overflow-auto overscroll-auto p-8 text-gray-600 dark:bg-gray-800 dark:text-gray-400">
  <p>
    Well, let me tell you something, funny boy. Y'know that little stamp, the
    one that says "New York Public Library"? Well that may not mean anything
    to you, but that means a lot to me. One whole hell of a lot.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sure, go ahead, laugh if you want to. I've seen your type before: Flashy,
    making the scene, flaunting convention. Yeah, I know what you're thinking.
    What's this guy making such a big stink about old library books? Well, let
    me give you a hint, junior.
  </p>
  <p>
    Maybe we can live without libraries, people like you and me. Maybe. Sure,
    we're too old to change the world, but what about that kid, sitting down,
    opening a book, right now, in a branch at the local library and finding
    drawings of pee-pees and wee-wees on the Cat in the Hat and the Five
    Chinese Brothers? Doesn't HE deserve better?
  </p>
</div>
:::

```html
<div class="overscroll-auto ...">是这样的，我说你这滑稽的小家伙，...</div>
```
::

### 响应式设计

使用断点变体（例如 `md:`）作为 `overscroll-behavior` 实用工具的前缀，以便仅在中等尺寸及以上的屏幕上应用该实用工具：

```html
<div class="overscroll-auto md:overscroll-contain ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```
